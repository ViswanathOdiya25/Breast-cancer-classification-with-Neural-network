# 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Network

This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network model to classify breast cancer as either **malignant** or **benign** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**. The goal is to aid early detection and diagnosis by leveraging machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#breast-cancer-dataset), available in `scikit-learn`. It contains 569 samples with 30 numerical features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

- **Classes**: Malignant (0), Benign (1)  
- **Features**: Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

## 🧮 Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The neural network includes:

- **Input Layer**: 30 neurons (one per feature)  
- **Hidden Layers**: 1–2 Dense layers (with ReLU activation)  
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation (binary classification)
